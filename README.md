# Data-Visualization-Pattern-Identification-In-Metropolitan-Cities

Understanding the evolution on the social and environmental aspects of a big city, for example Barcelona, is a hard task, given the complex and even subjective answers one might obtain. Driven by the motivation to clarify such questions, this project seeks a better understanding regarding those topics about Barcelona, aiming to comprehend how and if the city has been evolving over the most recent years, by analysing social indicators, such as immigration and emigration, birth rates, life expectancy, unemployment and accidents, and also environmental ones, such as tree plantations. 

To achieve this, data visualisations will be used in order to develop clarifications on the subject, by mapping data to visual variables, providing an easier way of understanding Barcelonaâ€™s people and environment. Thus, this project has the purpose of finding a better and more complete way of presenting answers about Barcelona, extending the textual and statistical information provided by the various data sets.
